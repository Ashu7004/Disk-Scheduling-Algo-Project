            <h2>What is Disk Scheduling Algorithm?</h2>
            <p>
              'Disk Scheduling Algorithm' is an algorithm that keeps and manages
              input and output requests arriving for the disk in a system. As we
              know, for executing any process memory is required. And when it
              comes to accessing things from a hard disk, the process becomes
              very slow as a hard disk is the slowest part of our computer.
              There are various methods by which the process can be scheduled
              and can be done efficiently.

              <h3>FCFS</h3>
              FCFS is the simplest disk scheduling algorithm. As the name
              suggests, this algorithm entertains requests in the order they
              arrive in the disk queue. The algorithm looks very fair and there
              is no starvation (all requests are serviced sequentially) but
              generally, it does not provide the fastest service.</a

              <h3>SSTF</h3>
              Shortest seek time first (SSTF) algorithm selects the disk I/O
              request which requires the least disk arm movement from its
              current position regardless of the direction. It reduces the total
              seek time as compared to FCFS. It allows the head to move to the
              closest track in the service queue.</a

              <h3>SCAN</h3>

              In SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, head starts from one end of the
              disk and moves towards the other end, servicing requests in
              between one by one and reach the other end. Then the direction of
              the head is reversed and the process continues as head
              continuously scan back and forth to access the disk.</a

              <h3>C-SCAN</h3>
              Circular SCAN (C-SCAN) scheduling algorithm is a modified version
              of SCAN disk scheduling algorithm that deals with the inefficiency
              of SCAN algorithm by servicing the requests more uniformly. Like
              SCAN (Elevator Algorithm) C-SCAN moves the head from one end
              servicing all the requests to the other end.</a

              The LOOK algorithm services request similarly as SCAN algorithm
              meanwhile it also “looks” ahead as if there are more tracks that
              are needed to be serviced in the same direction. If there are no
              pending requests in the moving direction the head reverses the
              direction and start servicing requests in the opposite
              direction.</a

              <h3>CIRCULAR LOOK</h3>
              In this algorithm, the head services requests only in one
              direction until all the requests in this direction are not
              serviced and then jumps back to the farthest request on the other
              direction and service the remaining requests which gives a better
              uniform servicing as well as avoids wasting seek time for going
              till the end of the disk.</a
